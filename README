gpg_parser is a library which tries to implement gpg in JavaScript.

Currently only verification of clearsigned signatures in combination with armored keys is implemented.

Key integrity is not checked, so no web of trust and no revokations will come into action.

The Following signature-algorithms are currently supported:
-DSA
-RSA

The Following hash-algorithms are currently supported:
- md5
- sha1
- sha-256
- sha-384
- sha-512
- ripemd160

HOWTO use:

You will need all JavaScript files from the lib-directory loaded on your page (you only need to have the hash-algorithms loaded which you'll use).

For a full usage excample see the checkSignature-function in test.html.

In GPGKey.js and SignedMessage.js are some Hints included too.
